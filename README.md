Learn with spaced repetition. Algorithm improved constantly. Use a simple Google Spreadsheet to launch and store your vocabulary.

## Create new dataset

1. Create a new [Blank Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/)

2. Add two or three columns like this (the *extra* column is optional):

| **word**   | **meaning**   | **extra**   |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| hola       | hello         |             |
| adiÃ³s      | bye           |             |

3. **Important**: publish it. File > Publish to the web... > **Publish**

4. Copy the url and paste it in the "Sheet url"

This is NOT open-source. I might want to launch this in the future as an app with some form of monetization, so the content here (unlike [most of my other projects](http://github.com/franciscop/)) is proprietary. The datasets that I didn't create have their corresponding author properly credited.
