Learn with spaced repetition. Algorithm improved constantly. Use a simple Google Spreadsheet to launch and store your vocabulary.

## Create new dataset

1. Create a new [Blank Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/)

2. Add two or three columns like this (the *extra* column is optional):

| **word**   | **meaning**   | **extra**   |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| hola       | hello         |             |
| adiÃ³s      | bye           |             |

The first word will be the one shown by default and the second one the one displayed below (and the one to guess). The third one is the pronuntiation or an extra note you wanna write.

3. **Important**: publish it. File > Publish to the web... > **Publish**

4. Copy the url and paste it in the "Sheet url"

This is NOT open-source. I might want to launch this in the future as an app with some form of monetization, so the content here (unlike [most of my other projects](http://github.com/franciscop/)) is proprietary. The datasets that I didn't create have their corresponding author properly credited.
